In today's world, the use of energy is quickly expanding. We are experiencing a lack of energy as a result of increased energy consumption in some regions of the world, which is causing environmental damage. We are dealing with excessive energy consumption in home appliances in some places, so our main goal in this project is to analyze what factors are influencing the increasing energy consumption of home appliances, how we can reduce energy consumption of home appliances, and analyze energy consumption of appliances using  python moduels. This project will analyze the Energy dataset using visualizations and graphs created with Python packages such as pandas,numpy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc

For approximately 4.5 months, the data set is set to 10 minutes. A ZigBee wireless sensor network was used to monitor the house's temperature and humidity levels. Every wireless node reported the temperature and humidity levels every 3.3 minutes. The wireless data was then averaged over 10 minute periods. The energy data was recorded every 10 minutes using m-bus energy metres.
